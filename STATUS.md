## Artifact Evaluated: Functional 
We provide the dataset and model checkpoints to replicate the main experiment
of our technical paper.
We document these artifacts with three Markdown files as follows.
- **README.md** contains the file structure of this replication package, the 
necessary instructions to test the main experiments of our technical paper,
and a summary of the training phase.
- **STATUS.md** is this file.
- **LICENSE** file describes the distribution rights.
- **INSTALL.md** contains necessary instructions. It contains a very basic 
usage example or a method to test the installation.

## Artifact Available: Available
As recommended, we have uploaded the scripts in a publicly available archival 
repository â€” Software Heritage with a unique document object identifier (DOI).
Since, our dataset and model checkpoint are quite large, we exclude them from
the source scripts, and separately place them in another open archive Zenodo.
The dataset also have a unique DOI.
